== Camunda BPM Taskpool

> A component for building Camunda BPM task lists with user tasks and business data in distributed scenarios.

In the last five years, we built different process applications on behalf of the customer several times. It turned out
that some of the issues occurred every time during the implementation.

These were:

* coping with performance issues if big amount of tasks is available
* creating high-performance custom queries for pre-loading process variables for tasks
* creating high-performance custom queries to pre-load business data associated with the process instance
* high-performance retrieving a list of tasks from several process engines
* repetitive queries with same result
* creating an archive view for business data items handled during the process execution
* creating an audit log of changes performed on business data items

We decided to stop repetitive work and release an open-source library which builds a foundation for
solving these problems.

=== Features

* User task API providing attributes important for processing
* Mirroring tasks: provides a copy of all tasks in the system
* Reacts on all task life cycle events fired by the process engine
* High performance queries: creates of read-optimized projections including task-, process- and business data
* Centralized task list: allows to collect tasks from multiple engines
* Data enrichment: enrich tasks with business data
* Data entry API providing attributes important for processing
* Audit-Trail creation on business event emission
