== Introduction


In the last five years, we built different process applications on behalf of the customer several times.
Most of them were built based on Single Page Application (SPA) technologies, but some were
using server-side rendered views. It turned out that some of the issues occurred every time during the implementation.

These were:

* coping with performance issues if big amount of tasks is available
* creating high-performance custom queries for pre-loading process variables for tasks
* creating high-performance custom queries to pre-load business data associated with the process instance
* high-performance retrieving a list of tasks from several process engines
* repetitive queries with same result
* creating an archive view for business data items handled during the process execution
* creating an audit log of changes performed on business data items

We decided to stop repetitive work and release an open-source library which builds a foundation for
solving these problems. The goal of this project is to provide such component as a library, to be
used in the integration layer between the Camunda BPM engine and the task list application.


== Quick Start

If you just want to start using the library, please consult our link:https://www.holunda.io/camunda-bpm-taskpool/quick-start[Quick Start]
guide.

== User Guide

If you have any questions regarding configuration of individual components of Camunda BPM Taskpool please
have a look to our primary documentation - the link:https://www.holunda.io/camunda-bpm-taskpool/wiki/user-guide[User Guide].

== Working Example

See our link:https://www.holunda.io/camunda-bpm-taskpool/wiki/user-guide/examples[Sample Process Application] including a simple task list
implementation for demonstration purposes.

== License

This library is developed under link:https://www.holunda.io/camunda-bpm-taskpool/license[Apache License 2].
