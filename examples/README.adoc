= Sample Approval Application

The following application is an example demonstrating the usage of the Camunda BPM Taskpool. The application is 
built as a SpringBoot process application and shows a simple approval process.

== Preparations 

Before you begin, please build the entire project with `mvn clean install` from the command line. 

Before starting the application, please start the Axon Server. The easiest way to do so is to run:

----
docker run -d --name my-axon-server -p 8024:8024 -p 8124:8124 axoniq/axonserver
----
 
To verify it is running, open your browser http://localhost:8024/[http://localhost:8024/].

The demo application consists of several Maven modules. In order to start the example, you will need to start only three
of them:
 
- h2 (external database)
- process-application (example application)
- taskpool-application
 
The modules can be started by running

----
mvn spring-boot:run
----
 
from command line in the corresponding directories. 

Since the process application includes Camunda BPM engine, you can use the standard Camunda webapps by navigating to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
The default user and password are `admin / admin `. 

The taskpool application consists of the major taskpool components and delivers the example tasklist.
To use the example tasklist, please call http://localhost:8081/tasklist/[http://localhost:8081/tasklist/]
in your browser.

== Tasklist

The currently implemented tasklist is a simple application (implemented as a single-page-application based on Angular 6) that shows the list of taks
available in the task pool. In doing so it provides the ability to filter, sort and page tasks with correlated business events. Here is how it looks like now:

image::tasklist-angular/docs/tasklist-angular-classic.png["Angualar Tasklist, classic representation of tasks"]
image::tasklist-angular/docs/tasklist-angular-data.png["Angualar Tasklist, representation of tasks with correlated data"]

=== Features

  - Lists tasks in the system for a dummy user (kermit)
  - Tasks include information about the process, name, description, create time, due date, priority and assignment.
  - Tasks include process data (from process instance)
  - Tasks include correlated business data
  - The tasklist is sortable
  - The list is paged (7 items per page)
  - Claiming / Unclaiming
  - Jump to form

=== Ongoing / TODO

  - Filtering

== Architecture

The following storyboard can be used to understand the Camunda BPM Taskpool mechanics. The following sample
approval process has been implemented:

image::process-application/src/main/resources/process_approve_request.png[Approval Process]

=== Business context
 
Imagine a system that responsible for management of all requests in the company. Using this system, you can submit requests which then get 
eventually approved or rejected. Sometimes, the approver doesn't approve or reject but returns the request back to the originator (that is the person,
who submitted the request). Then, the originator can amend the request and resubmit it or cancel the request. 

=== Technical context

Imagine the company has the system for request management at place (it could be an ERP system) which is the primary contact point for request storage.
A request can be created, loaded and modified by this system. Our example application integrates with this system and starts a process as soon as a new request
has been submitted.

For demonstration purposes the request management system already contains four requests (with request ids 1, 2, 3 and 4) which can be used to
get approved using the approval workflow.

The example process applications provides REST APIs for interaction and offers the Swagger UI for easier usage.
If you want to explore the API, simply open http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html[http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html] to use Swagger UI.

== Storyboard

- To start the approval process for a given request open your browser and navigate to the process starter at:
http://localhost:8080/example-process-approval/start[http://localhost:8080/example-process-approval/start]

- Enter the request id 1 and click _Start_. The start form will disappear and redirect to the tasklist where the
new approval request process created one task with the name _Approve Request_.

- Examine the task details by clicking _Data_ tab in _Details_ column. You can see the data of the request correlated to
the current process instance.

- Let's assume the salary increase request is too high and we want to inform kermit about this. We are not rejecting the 
request completely, but returning it to back to kermit with the comment, that this year, the salary increase limit is 750 GBP.
To do so click on the task name which opens the user task form _Approve Request_ and complete the task, by
 selecting the _Return request to originator_ option and clicking the _Complete_ button. The process will create
a new user task `Amend Request` for the originator, who is kermit which is visible in the tasklist.

- Kermit should now change the amount of the request in the "legacy" application and re-submit the request. For doing so, click
on task named _Amend Approval Request_, change the amount to a value below 750 GBP and complete the task by selecting the
_Re-submit request_ option and clicking on _Complete_ button.

- Again, let's examine the data correlated with the task. Note that the amount is changed, despite the fact that the
request amount is not a data item available to the process instance but is still available in the task list.
