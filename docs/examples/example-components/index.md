title: Example Components
---

For demonstration purposes we built several example components and reuse them to demonstrate the [Example application](../example-approval.md) in
different [Usage Scenarios](../scenarios/). These components are not part of a polyflow distribution and serve demonstration
purposes only. They still show implementation of components which needs to be implemented by you and are not part of the provided library.
If you are interested in the source code, please visit the [Polyflow Repository](https://github.com/holunda-io/polyflow-examples).

## Process Application Example Components

To show the integration of Polyflow components into a Process Application, the process discussed in
[Example Approval application](../example-approval.md) has been implemented.

* [Process Application Frontend](pa-frontend.md)
* [Process Application Backend](pa-backend.md)

## Process Platform Example Components

To show the integration of Polyflow components into a Process Platform, a simple task list and
a workpieces view (archive view for business objects) has been implemented.

* [Process Platform Frontend](pp-frontend.md)
* [Process Platform Backend](pp-backend.md)

## Shared Example Components

Components used by other example components.

* [User Management](user-management.md)
