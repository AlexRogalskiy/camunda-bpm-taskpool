### Purpose

The Polyflow View API defines the interfaces of the task-pool and data-pool query API. It defines the main queries of the common read-projections.
Its main purpose is to create a public stable API which is independent of the implementations. There are multiple implementations available:

* [In-Memory View](view-simple.md)
* [JPA View](view-jpa.md)
* [Mongo DB View](view-mongo.md)
