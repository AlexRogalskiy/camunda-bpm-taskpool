## View Filtering

### Purpose

The purpose of the filtering component is to provide main common implementations for handling requests of filtering of view results in form of 
attribute filters (like `attribute=value&attrubute2=value2&task.name=taskname`). Especially it defines the main concepts like `Criteria` and `Operator`
and allows classification of those. This component is helpful if you implement your own view.
