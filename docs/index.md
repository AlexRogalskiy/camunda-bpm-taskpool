## Why should I use this?

* You are building a process application or platform that comprises multiple process engines?
* You are building a custom task list for your Camunda process application?
* You want to include custom business object attributes to your tasks in the task list?
* You have performance issues with your task list?
* You need to provide a view on the business objects processed by your processes?
