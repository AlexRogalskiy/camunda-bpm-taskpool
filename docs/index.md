## Why should I use this?

* Are you building a process application or process platform containing multiple process applications
  using Camunda BPM Engine?
* Are you building a custom task list for your existing application using
  Camunda BPM Engine?
* Are you trying to solve performance issues with your task list?
* Are you building an archive view for the business objects processed by your processes?
