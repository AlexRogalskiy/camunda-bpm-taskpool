=== Purpose

The component is responsible for maintaining and storing the consistent state of the datapool
core concept of Business Data Entry.

The component receives all commands and emits events, if changes are performed on underlying entities.
The event stream is used to store all changes (purely event-sourced) and should be used by all other
parties interested in changes.
