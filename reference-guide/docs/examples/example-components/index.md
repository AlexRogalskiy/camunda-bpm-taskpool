title: Example Components
---

For demonstration purposes we built several example components and reuse them to demonstrate the [Example application](../example-application/) in
different [Usage Scenarios](../scenarios/). These components are not part of a polyflow distribution and serve demonstration
purposes only. They still show implementation of components which needs to be implemented by you and are not part of the provided library.

## Process Application Example Components

To show the integration of Polyflow components into a Process Application, the process discussed in
[Example application](../example-application/) has been implemented.

* [Process Application Frontend](pa-frontend)
* [Process Application Backend](pa-backend)

## Process Platform Example Components

To show the integration of Polyflow components into a Process Platform, a simple task list and
a workpieces view (archive view for business objects) has been implemented.

* [Process Platform Frontend](pp-frontend)
* [Process Platform Backend](pp-backend)

## Shared Example Components

Components used by other example components.

* [User Management](user-management)
